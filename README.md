## Potential Improvments

- Persist query params in the URL on the users tab
- Create context for the roles table, similar to what I created for the users table
- Create a better naming scheme for the colors
- Add a fallback image when the user image URL does not exist
- Update the styling of the roles table to wrap the "Description" column instead of the "Created" column
